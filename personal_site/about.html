            I am a very active sports person and car enthusiast. When I'm not working, I'm usually doing one of the following...

            <h2>Playing Badminton</h2>
            <img id=badminton src="https://blog.playo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wp2094182-scaled.jpg">
            <p class="p1">Badminton is one of those sports that you don't see or hear too often about. I thought the same until I met my wife and she introduced me to the sport! I was mostly playing table tennis and soccer before but I met my wife through work and she invited me to try out badminton. At first I thought it was those backyard games that you play for fun but once I started playing, I realized how much more there is to the sport and how much fun it is. </p>
            <p class="p1">I have been training and playing for nearly a year now and I can say that this sport requires alot of running and strength. I have done a few tournaments with my wife and while we do play competitively, we also have fun playing with our friends too.</p>

            <h2>Building/Fixing Cars</h2>
            <img id="car" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFz9kNkXwAM0oWv?format=jpg&name=large">
            <p class="p1">Ever since I was little, my parents didn't have much money. They were immigrants who came over from Vietnam with no other family in the US. I remember in my earliest childhood memories, I would always go along with my parents to get their cars fixed because since they didn't have much money, they couldn't afford a reliable car. Because of this, their cars kept breaking down and I would see that they have to spend so much money on repeairs and sometimes we didn't have enough money to eat.</p>
            <p class="p1">I started to take an interest in cars and how they work so that when I was old enough, I would be able to save my parents money and fix cars on my own. When I turned 18, I got a job at a Toyota dealership with the help of my friend and after 2 years, I went from barely knowing how to change my oil to becoming an ASE Certified Master Diagnostic Mechanic.</p>
            <p class="p1">Since then, I have not only taken an interest to fixing cars, I also like to modify and track my cars as well.</p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>

            <p class="p1">When I was young, I was kind of shy. I didn't go outside as much and I would mostly enjoy playing video games. I had a nintendo gamecube when I was younger and I would always play games like Mario Kart or Pokemon during my free time. That would then eventually turn into much bigger games like Maplestory and Tera. Then when I was older, my friends invited me to play League of Legends with them. This was when the game first came out and I had never played a MOBA before.</p>
            <p class="p1">After I played with them for a couple of hours, I was completely hooked onto the game. I spent thousands of hours grinding and playing ranked hoping to get better. Eventually I hit Diamond 1 which is less than the top 0.1% of all the players in the world and I was on my College's League of Legends team. We almost made it to the finals and was on the big stage as well.</p>
            <p class="p1">Soon after I graduated college, I stopped playing video games as often as I did and I was more focused on getting a job and eventually saving up money to buy a house one day.</p>
