            <p class="p1"> I started working as a mechanic in 2016 aboout a year after I graduated high school. I started at World Toyota just changing oil and rotating tires. Eventually I became ASE certified and moved to a different Toyota Dealership as a line mechanic where I would do bigger jobs such as recalls, warranty, rebuilding engines, replacing suspension, etc. </p>
            <p class="p1">Then in 2019, I had become an ASE Certified Master Diagnostic Mechanic and I just graduated college with a Bachelors of Science in Chemistry as well. I had the option of either continuing in the automotive industry or finding a career in my field of study. I decided that I wanted to find a job in my field of study because while I enjoyed working as a mechanic, it is a very difficult job and also very taxing on my body as well. I figured for my health and income security, it would be better to find a job in Chemistry as eventually I realized that one day, all gas vehicles will be replaced with electric vehicles that require virtually no maintenance.</p>

            <h2> Starting my first job in the Laboratory.</h2>
            <img id="gp" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/v1397185039/1d14523aa3c4517e6869ebca75853efb.jpg">
            <p class="p1">In late 2019, I left my job at Toyota to work as an Analytical Laboratory Technician. I was excited as this was the first time I would be working in a chemistry lab. I worked at Georgia Pacific for over 8 months and during that time, I had learned a ton of new skills and had polished my skills in testing, writing reports, etc.</p>
            <p class="p1">While I did meet alot of great people and enjoyed my time there, unfortunately I left that position because I felt like there was more opportunity elsewhere for me. The only thing I did not like about that job is that it was very far from home for me. I left the job after 8 months and lucily i got a job as a Chemical Process Engineer at a small comapny called Chemence.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>My first Chemical Engineer Position</h2>
            <img id="chemence" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1474236/CHE20_Chemence_Logo_CMYK__Full_Color_Horizontal_Logo.jpg?p=facebook">
            <p class="p1">After I left Georgia pacific, I started a position as a Chemical Process Engineer over at Chemence. I was able to obtain this position even though my major and field of study was in the laboratory due to my past mechanical experience working at Toyota. I was very lucky to get this job because working as a Chemical Engineer, I was able to gain more valuable experience as opposed to sitting in a laboratory and test samples. Everytime I moved jobs, I always thought about the future and how secure is the job and if it was okay for my health. I felt that becoming a chemical engineer would be able to generate more potential income at a faster rate than if I stayed in the laboratory.</p>
            <p class="p1">You may ask why am I here then if I thought Chemical Engineering was a good future and career path for me? I am here because I am tired of working in a position where I don't feel like I have any freedom and I have to do things in a certain way or kiss up to bosses to get where I want. No matter what job I worked, it was always the same where many coworkers would obtain job security by mainly kissing up to their bosses. I would do alot of hard work but in the end it was not enough. So now I discovered this field where I know a few people that have recommended it to me and I feel like if I miss out on this chance, I would regret it later on.</p>
